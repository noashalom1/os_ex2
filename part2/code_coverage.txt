Code Coverage Report – Part 2: Molecule Supplier & Requester

Assumption:
-----------
This implementation supports exactly four molecule types:
- WATER              → composed of 2 HYDROGEN and 1 OXYGEN atoms
- CARBON DIOXIDE     → composed of 1 CARBON and 2 OXYGEN atoms
- ALCOHOL            → composed of 2 CARBON, 6 HYDROGEN, and 1 OXYGEN atoms
- GLUCOSE            → composed of 6 CARBON, 12 HYDROGEN, and 6 OXYGEN atoms

Tested Functionality:
---------------------
✓ ADD atoms via TCP:
    - Example: "ADD OXYGEN 10"
    - Result: OXYGEN count increases and inventory is printed

✓ DELIVER molecules via UDP:
    - Example: "DELIVER ALCOHOL 1"
    - Result: Atom inventory is reduced correctly and confirmation is returned

✓ Multi-word molecule support:
    - Example: "DELIVER CARBON DIOXIDE 2"
    - Result: Correctly matched recipe and updated inventory

✓ Invalid molecule handling:
    - Example: "DELIVER PIZZA 2"
    - Result: Returns "ERROR: Unknown molecule 'PIZZA'"

✓ Insufficient atom check:
    - Example: Requesting more molecules than available atoms
    - Result: Returns precise error including which atom is missing and how many

✓ Inventory display:
    - Atom counts printed to server console after each change

✓ Error messages printed to server stderr as well as sent to client

Example Run:
------------
Atom_supplier:
    ADD CARBON 100
    ADD OXYGEN 10
    ADD HYDROGEN 100

Client:
    DELIVER ALCOHOL 1
    Server response: OK: Delivered 1 ALCOHOL molecules
    DELIVER CARBON DIOXIDE 2
    Server response: OK: Delivered 2 CARBON DIOXIDE molecules
    DELIVER GLUCOSE 5
    Server response: ERROR: Not enough atoms – missing 25 OXYGEN
    DELIVER PIZZA 2
    Server response: ERROR: Unknown molecule 'PIZZA'

Server Output:
    CARBON: 100, OXYGEN: 0, HYDROGEN: 0
    CARBON: 100, OXYGEN: 10, HYDROGEN: 0
    CARBON: 100, OXYGEN: 10, HYDROGEN: 100
    CARBON: 98, OXYGEN: 9, HYDROGEN: 94
    CARBON: 96, OXYGEN: 5, HYDROGEN: 94
    ERROR: Not enough atoms – missing 25 OXYGEN
    ERROR: Unknown molecule 'PIZZA'

Conclusion:
-----------
The code correctly handles all valid input formats for the four supported molecules.
It provides clear error messages, prevents invalid actions, and maintains accurate inventory management.
No extra molecule formats or flexible syntax is supported, as per the design decision.
